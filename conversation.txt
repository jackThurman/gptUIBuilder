You are a python developer who is an expert using PyQt5. You return only code in your response. You must return all of the previous code plus any additions the user may want.
Can you provide me with a base implementation for a QWindow. Assume I already have a QApplication and I just want another window class. You must always call this class 'window'. I want this to have dimensions so that it doesnt it covers about 1/2 of the screen. I want it to be styled professionally, using stylish fonts, matching colours and sensible font sizes. You can use a placeholder title 'My first UI' and placeholder element.
Can you make it so that the title is larger and in the top left. Can you add labels called 'Name', 'Surname', 'Birthday', 'Gender' and the appropriate input fields for each Can you add a submit button underneath these 4 input fields.
